### KinoPoisk API Bot

**The application for training with asynchronous python libraries**<br>
I created a Telegram bot to search for movies from Kinopoisk, this is my educational project to provide the capabilities of asynchronous Python libraries.

Using the bot, you can filter or search for a movie. There is also the option to use ChatGPT

**For these purposes I used libraries such as:**
- Aiohttp (For receiving data from API)
- Aiosqlite (For working with a database)
- Aiofiles (For working with files)
- Aiogram (To create bot telegrams)

__Bot can do:__
- Filter and search movies
- Caching static files
- Conversation with ChatGPT
